## Final Project: Currency Converter

* **Note for final project**: Do a currency converter using [fixer.io](https://fixer.io/).
  * Check out currency files in the source code for the ORM &amp; API lecture (lecture 4).
    - **DAMN IT**: Lecture 5 example `currency` does this. Maybe I can just improve on what the lecturer has already done.

**NOTE**: If I do a currency conversion project, I should use the [CurrencyLayer API](https://currencylayer.com/documentation). Also, I have created my own JSON API of [currency names and their abbreviations](https://api.myjson.com/bins/13ga9t). Of course, I may also do a [Flask micro-blog](https://github.com/pulamusic/flaskMicroBlog) for the final project; I haven't yet made up my mind.
