## Final Project: Currency Converter

* **Note for final project**: Do a currency converter using [fixer.io](https://fixer.io/).
  * Check out currency files in the source code for the ORM &amp; API lecture (lecture 4).
    - **DAMN IT**: Lecture 5 example `currency` does this. Maybe I can just improve on what the lecturer has already done.
